# Coding-Projects-Hub
Welcome to my Coding Projects Hub 🗂️  
Here, you'll find all the coding projects I've worked on. 💻 Whether for professional purposes or just for fun, if I’ve touched it, it’s included here. 🔢

To keep things organized, **every project has its own folder 📁** named accordingly. Inside each, you'll find:

- 1️⃣ The code related to that specific project.
- 2️⃣ A short explanation of what the program does (usually included in the README file).
- 3️⃣ Any related files or folders.

Feel free to explore 🔎 any folder you like. However, please note that my code might be a little messy — I'm not a professional developer, just a DA who enjoys learning something new.  
I welcome any comments or feedback; just reach out 📩 and I’ll be happy to chat 💬.

**Note**: Any work-related project has been approved for posting, with all sensitive information and data omitted to protect privacy.

# Coding-Projects-Hub
Welcome to my Coding Projects Hub 🗂️  
Here, you'll find all the coding projects I've worked on. 💻 Whether for professional purposes or just for fun, if I’ve touched it, it’s included here. 🔢

To keep things tidy, **every project has its own folder 📁**  
Each folder name gives a hint about what the project is about. If it seems a bit brief, don’t worry — each program comes with a description file to walk you through the project. That, of course, isn't the only thing inside the folder. You'll find also:

- 1️⃣ **Code**: The code lines related to that specific project.
- 2️⃣ **Description**: A short explanation of what the program does (usually included in the README file).
- 3️⃣ **Other Files/Folders**: Any file/folder useful for the program.

Feel free to explore 🔎 any folder you like.   
⚠️ Beware that you are entering in an extremely dangerous zone ⚠️  
My code might be a little messy. I'm not a top-notch dev, I am just a BDA who enjoys learning something new after all. That's why I'm open to any comment or feedbacks that will help me improve as a coder.   
Just reach out 📩 -- I'll be happy to hear that. 💬
